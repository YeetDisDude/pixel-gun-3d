# Plist generator for plist files
This is for making modded skin packs for ***iOS*** Pixel Gun 3D. I am not explaining how to use this as you should figure out how to use it your self
## Important
- *dict.txt* will be overwritten once the python script is ran
-  Use if you know what you're doing 
- No other libraries needed to run this script
- This is for iOS Plist files!

## Plist file format:

- ***current equiped skin:***

\<key>Name Current Skin\</key>

\<string>\</string>


- ***skin base64:***

\<key>User Skins\</key>

\<string>\</string>

- ***skin names:***

\<key>User Name Skins\</key>
